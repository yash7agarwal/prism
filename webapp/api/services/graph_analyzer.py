"""Pure-Python graph analysis utilities for the AppUAT screen graph.

Used by the deeplink_utility planner to find structural issues:
- Orphan screens (no incoming edges) — possibly only reachable via deeplink
- Dead-end screens (no outgoing edges) — confirmation/terminal screens or stuck flows
- Dangling leads_to_hints — element-level navigation pointing to non-existent screens
- Unreachable screens — no path from a designated home screen

No LLM calls. All deterministic.

Inputs use the same dict shapes as routes/screens.py — list of plain dicts (not ORM
objects) so this module is easy to test in isolation.
