Operational insights from UAT runs, mistakes, and session audits.

## Context Bandwidth Audit — Session 2026-04-09

### L1: Pre-spawn file reading is the #1 context waste
**What happened**: Before spawning 3 build agents (self-healing, emulator, Telegram bot), the main session read ~1,900 lines of source files (orchestrator.py, scenario_runner_agent.py, CLAUDE.md, android_device.py, setup_emulator.sh). The spawned agents then re-read the same files themselves.

**Cost**: ~3,800 lines of context consumed for what should have been a single 200-word codebase summary.

**Rule**: Never read source files in the main session before spawning an implementation agent. Instead:
1. Spawn an Explore agent: "Summarize the relevant parts of this codebase for implementing X. Return under 300 words."
2. Pass that summary to the implementation agent's prompt.

---

### L2: Log analysis must always be delegated
**What happened**: `railway logs` returned 41KB of build/runtime output. It was read inline, then grepped inline. Two main-session turns wasted on raw log processing.

**Cost**: 41KB inline + grep results in context.

**Rule**: Any command that may produce > 2KB of output must be delegated to a subagent with a specific question. Pattern:
```
Agent: "Run `railway logs --service X`, find why the container crashed, return the error in under 50 words."
```

---

### L3: Debugging reads should be scoped subagents, not inline chunks
**What happened**: When the Railway deployment failed, bot.py was read in 3 separate chunks (lines 1-60, 60-140, 460-500) plus a grep, all in main context, to find a startup crash.

**Cost**: ~300 lines of context + 3 turns to identify 2 bugs that a focused subagent would find in 1 turn.

**Rule**: Any debugging that requires reading > 1 file or > 100 lines total → spawn a debug subagent:
```
"File X is crashing at startup on Railway. Read telegram_bot/bot.py and identify the startup crash. Return: root cause + fix in under 100 words."
```

---

### L4: Deployment polling burns turns
**What happened**: Used 4× `sleep + railway deployment list` loops in the main session to monitor a Railway deployment. Each consumed a conversation turn.

**Cost**: 4 wasted turns waiting for an external process.

**Rule**: Background deployment monitoring via `run_in_background=True` on a monitoring agent, or use a single long-timeout Bash command. Never poll in a loop in the main session.

---

### L5: Double-read pattern when delegating late
**What happened**: Main session read files to understand context, then spawned agents that re-read the same files to do the work.

**Rule**: Default assumption is "delegate first". If you catch yourself reading a file to understand context for a future agent → stop, put that reading IN the agent's prompt as a task, not as pre-work in the main session.

## UAT Operational Learnings

### L6: Emulator image size matters for cloud deployment
The full Android SDK Docker image (~4GB) crashes Railway's free tier immediately. Keep a lightweight `Dockerfile.bot` (~200MB) for the always-on Telegram interface. Heavy emulator runs stay on the device host.

### L7: python -m vs direct script for package imports
Running `python telegram_bot/run_bot.py` adds `telegram_bot/` to sys.path. Running `python -m telegram_bot.run_bot` adds the CWD to sys.path. Always use `-m` for packages that import from sibling packages.

### L8: Orchestrator signature must be passed correctly to background threads
The Telegram bot's background UAT thread must use the exact Orchestrator.__init__ signature: `candidate_apk`, `feature_description`, `accounts` (as a list, not a file path). Loading accounts.json must happen before instantiating the Orchestrator.
