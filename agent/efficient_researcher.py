"""Efficient research module — deterministic search + single LLM synthesis.

Instead of 10-15 LLM calls per work item (tool-use loop), this module:
1. Runs web searches from a planner-generated plan (not hardcoded seeds)
2. Fetches and extracts content from top results (no LLM needed)
3. Makes ONE LLM call to synthesize findings from the raw data
4. Returns both synthesized candidates and the retrieval bundle so callers
   can run the source_url validator before writing to the KG.

Synthesis provider priority (Phase 1 of the research-architecture rework):
  Claude (Sonnet) — default, highest fidelity for synthesis
  Groq (Llama)   — only if PRISM_SYNTH_CHEAP=1 in env (cheap-mode opt-in)
  Gemini          — fallback when Claude is unavailable

Rationale: synthesis is the stage where hallucination matters most; we no
longer default to free-tier Llama here.

- Obvious moves everyone knows
- Trends that belong to OTHER industries (if the subject is a food-delivery
  app, do not emit travel trends; if the subject is fintech, do not emit
  hospitality trends, etc.) — cross-industry leakage is a bug.

DO extract:
- Specific underserved segments with unmet needs
- Behavioral shifts that create new JTBD (Jobs To Be Done)
- Emerging categories with quantified demand
- Regulatory / platform / infrastructure changes creating new needs
- Named product-strategy moves by competitors that reveal a gap

For each trend, provide:
- "name": specific, named pattern (not a vague phrase)
- "description": 3-4 sentences — the consumer need, why it's underserved, what a product could do
- "timeline": "past" | "present" | "emerging" | "future"
- "category": "consumer_behavior" | "technology" | "regulation" | "demographics" | "market_structure"
- "quantification": {{"search_volume": "...", "market_size": "...", "growth_rate": "...", "user_demand": "..."}} — include only figures actually present in the raw data; omit keys without evidence
- "jtbd": the job the customer is trying to get done
- "product_opportunity": what {brief.project_name} could build
- "source_url": a URL from the raw data above (MANDATORY — candidates without a valid source_url will be rejected)

3RD ORDER THINKING EXPLAINED:
Most analysts stop at 2nd order: "AI → companies build AI features." That's obvious.
3rd order asks: "And THEN what happens?"

Example of good 3rd order chain:
- Trend: "Rise of AI trip planners"
- 2nd order: "OTAs integrate AI for personalized recommendations"
- 3rd order: "AI planners recommend off-beat destinations based on user preferences →
  demand shifts from top-10 tourist cities to Tier-3 towns → hotels in small towns
  see a significant booking increase → {project_name}'s hotel supply team needs to
  urgently onboard new properties in small towns OR lose this demand to Airbnb which
  already has home-stay inventory there"

That 3rd order effect is ACTIONABLE — it tells the PM exactly what to build next.

BAD (generic, obvious):
- "AI will increase competition" — so what?
- "Companies will invest in technology" — meaningless
- "Users will benefit from better experience" — not actionable

GOOD (specific, non-obvious, actionable):
- "AI concierge substantially reduces post-booking support calls → {project_name}'s
  large call center becomes a cost liability → restructure to AI-first support yields
  major savings but requires a long migration timeline"

For each effect chain, think: "What does this mean the PM should BUILD or STOP BUILDING?"
